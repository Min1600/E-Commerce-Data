# E-Commerce Data Analysis

### Background and Overview

This project looks into Brazillian E-Commerce data made by [Olist store](/https://www.olist.com//), the data contains information of over 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at marketplaces all over Brazil. From the data the important metrics that will be looked at are the price, delivery time, product popularity, reviews and freight values. 

With this data we can find the most popular products in general as well as based on time of year which will help companies be aware of what products have high demand during specific times to better prepare for inventory management, marketing of products and sales. We can also find products that have low reviews and look deeper into the reasonings for these low reviews to make improvements to products. This allows better customer satisfaction in future and potentially better sales. Look into the effect of delivery times and price on reviews to better understand how to improve customer satisfaction.
